This is a fun project that I did for my private vbulletin forums. I do not own any intellectual property related to pokemon.

This repository only serves as an example of my own experience in creating a large project in PHP/HTML.
It was built ontop of vbulletin forums that I have been heavily modifying for the past 9 years.
Because of that, I do not expect anyone to be able to reuse the project on their own websites.
Any actual vbulletin code has been excluded from the repository. Any copyrighted images have also been excluded.

If anyone stumbles upon this repository and wants to reuse some snippets of the code for their own purposes, I don't really care. Just credit me if you're using a lot.


Lastly, I am fully aware that much of the code does not follow best practices. I am sure there are some vulnerabilities in the code.
I did this on my own as a passion project for a community of friends.
I did not have the time or resources to produce a professional level of quality or security.



I want to thank Rob Hornby for his help when I first began learning PHP in 2010.
Many of my coding skills and habits have come from him, and I wouldn't be surprised if some bits of code were originally written by him and then reused here.
